# **Computer Vision with OpenCV**

This project demonstrates how to apply **brightness** and **contrast** adjustments on images using **OpenCV** and **Streamlit**. Users can upload their images directly via the web interface and interactively tweak the brightness and contrast settings to see the effects in real time. The application showcases the power of **Computer Vision** with simple yet effective techniques.

## 🚀 **Live Demo**
